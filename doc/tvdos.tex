\chapter{\thedos}

\thedos\ is a Disk Operating System (usually) bundled with the distribution of the \thismachine.

All \thedos-related features requires the DOS to be fully loaded.


\chapter{Bootstrapping}

\index{boot process}\thedos\ goes through follwing progress to deliver the \code{A:\rs} prompt:

\section{Probing Bootable Devices}
BIOS

\section{The Bootloader}
LOADBOOT

Then the Bootsector will try to read and execute \code{A:\rs{}tvdos\rs{}TVDOS.SYS}

\section{TVDOS.SYS}
\thedos.SYS will load system libraries and variables and then will try to run the boot script by executing \code{A:\rs{}AUTOEXEC.BAT}

\section{AUTOEXEC.BAT}

AUTOEXEC can setup user-specific variables (e.g. keyboard layout) and launch the command shell of your choice, \code{COMMAND} is the most common shell.

Variables can be set or changed using \textbf{SET} commands.



\chapter{Coreutils}

\index{coreutils (DOS)}Coreutils are the core ``commands'' of \thedos.

\end{outline}



\chapter{Built-in Apps}

\index{built-in apps (DOS)}Built-in Applications are the programs shipped with the standard distribution of \thedos\ that is written for users' convenience.

This chapter will only briefly list and describe the applications.

\begin{outline}

\1\dossynopsis{true}{Returns errorlevel 0 upon execution.}
\end{outline}



\chapter{Writing Your Own Apps}

\index{user apps (DOS)}User-made Applications are basically a standard Javascript program, but \thedos\ provides DOS extensions for convenience.

User apps are invoked through \thedos\ to inject the command-line arguments and some necessary functionalities.

\section{Command-line Arguments}

The command line arguments are given via the array of strings named `exec\_args`.

Index zero holds the name used to invoke the app, and the rest hold the actual arguments.


\section{Invoking Coreutils on the user Apps}

DOS coreutils and some of the internal functions can be used on Javascript program.

To invoke the coreutils, use \code{\_G.shell.coreutils.*}

\begin{outline}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{resolvePathInput}[path]{Returns fully-qualified path of the input path, relative to the current working directory.}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{getPwdString}[]{Returns the current working directory as a string.}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{getCurrentDrive}[]{Returns the drive letter of the current working drive.}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{execute}[command]{Executes the DOS command.}
\end{outline}


\section{Termination Check Injection}

Due to the non-preemptive nature of the virtual machine, the termination\footnote{Default key combination: Shift+Ctrl+T+R} signal must be explicitly captured by the app, and taking care of it by yourself can be extremely tedious. Fortunately \thedos\ parses the user-written program and injects those checks accordingly.

While- and For-loops are always have such checks injected, but the `read()` is not checked for the termination.


\chapter{Pipes}

\index{pipe (DOS)}Pipe is a way to chain the IO of the one program/command into the different programs/commands in series.

A pipe can be either named or anonymous: named pipes are ones that are created by the user while the anonymous pipes are created by the DOS process as a result of the command pipelining.

\section{Command Pipelining}

In \thedos, a pipe can be used to route the output of a command into the other command. For example, \code{dir | less} will route the output of the \code{dir} into the text viewer called \code{less} so that the user can take their time examining the list of files in the directory, even if the list is taller that the terminal's height.

\section{User-defined Pipe}

A user program can create and interact with the pipe so long as it's \emph{named}. The contents of the pipe can be read and modified just like a Javascript variable.

Named pipes can be retrieved on \code{\_G.shell.pipes.*}

\section{Pipe-related Functions}

\begin{outline}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{getPipe}[]{Returns the currently opened pipe. \code{undefined} is returned if no pipes are opened.}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{appendToCurrentPipe}[text]{Appends the given text to the current pipe.}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{pushAnonPipe}[contents]{Pushes an anonymous pipe to the current pipe stack.}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{pushPipe}[pipeName, contents]{Pushes the pipe of given name to the current pipe stack.}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{hasPipe}[]{Returns true if there is a pipe currently opened.}
\1\inlinesynopsis[\_G.shell]{removePipe}[]{Destroys the currently opened pipe and returns it. Any pipes on the pipe stack will be shifted down to become the next current pipe.}
\end{outline}


\chapter{File I/O}
\index{filesystem (DOS)}In \thedos, drives are assigned with a drive letter, and the drive currently booted on is always drive \textbf{A}.


\section{The File Descriptor}
\index{file descriptor (DOS)}A file is virtualised through the \emph{file descriptor} which provides the functions to manipulate the file. Do note that when a file descriptor is created, the file is not yet opened by the drive.

To create a file descriptor, use the provided function \code{files.open(fullPath)}. \code{fullPath} is a fully qualified path of the file that includes the drive letter.

\section{Manipulating a File}
A file has folliwing properties and can be manipulated using following functions:

Properties:

\begin{outline}
\1\propertysynopsis{size}{Int}{Returns a size of the file in bytes.}
\1\propertysynopsis{path}{String}{Returns a path (NOT including the drive letter) of the file. Paths are separated using reverse solidus.}
\1\propertysynopsis{fullPath}{String}{Returns a fully qualified path (including the drive letter) of the file. Paths are separated using reverse solidus.}
\1\propertysynopsis{driverID}{String}{Returns a filesystem driver ID associated with the file.}
\1\propertysynopsis{driver}{[Object object]}{Returns a filesystem driver (a Javascript object) for the file.}
\1\propertysynopsis{isDirectory}{Boolean}{Returns true if the path is a directory.}
\1\propertysynopsis{name}{String}{Returns the name part of the file's path.}
\1\propertysynopsis{parentPath}{String}{Returns a parent path of the file.}
\1\propertysynopsis{exists}{Boolean}{Returns true if the file exists on the device.}
\end{outline}

Functions:

\begin{outline}
\1\formalsynopsis{pread}{pointer: Int, count: Int, offset: Int}{Reads the file bytewise and puts it to the memory starting from the pointer.}
 \2\argsynopsis{count}{how many bytes to read}
 \2\argsynopsis{offset}{when reading a file, how many bytes to skip initially}
\1\formalsynopsis{bread}{}[Array]{Reads the file bytewise and returns the content in Javascript array.}
\1\formalsynopsis{sread}{}[String]{Reads the file textwise and returns the content in Javascript string.}
\1\formalsynopsis{pwrite}{pointer: Int, count: Int, offset: Int}
{Writes the bytes stored in the memory starting from the pointer to file.\\Note: due to the limitation of the protocol, the non-zero offset is not supported on the serial-connected disk drives.}
 \2\argsynopsis{count}{how many bytes to write}
 \2\argsynopsis{offset}{when writing to the file, how many bytes on the file to skip before writing a first byte.}
\1\formalsynopsis{bwrite}{bytes: Uint8Array}{Writes the bytes to the file.}
\1\formalsynopsis{swrite}{string: String}{Writes the string to the file.}
\1\formalsynopsis{flush}{}{Flush the contents on the write buffer to the file immediately. Will do nothing if there is no write buffer implemented --- a write operation will always be performed imemdiately in such cases.}
\1\formalsynopsis{close}{}{Tells the underlying device (usually a disk drive) to close a file. When dealing with multiple files on a single disk drive (in which can only have a single active---or opened---file), the underlying filesystem driver will automatically swap the files around, so this function is normally unused.}
\1\formalsynopsis{list}{}[Array or undefined]{Lists files inside of the directory. If the path is indeed a directory, an array of file descriptors will be returned; \code{undefined} otherwise.}
\1\formalsynopsis{touch}{}[Boolean]{Updates the file's access time if the file exists; a new file will be created otherwise. Returns true if successful.}
\1\formalsynopsis{mkDir}{}[Boolean]{Creates a directory to the path. Returns true if successful.}
\1\formalsynopsis{mkFile}{}[Boolean]{Creates a new file to the path. Returns true if successful.}
\1\formalsynopsis{remove}{}[Boolean]{Removes a file. Returns true if successful.}
\end{outline}


\section{The Device Files}
