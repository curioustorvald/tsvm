TSVM Hardware Development Kit

Codes in the new computer hardware (e.g. EEPROM) are decrypted, decompressed
then executed, so your program must be minified, compressed, then encrypted to
be runnable, and this entire process is called "compiling".

Do note that this 'encryption' is highly insecure; its only purpose is to deter
the casual attemps at cracking.
