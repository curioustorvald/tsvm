\tbas{} is a BASIC dialect and its interpreter. \tbas{} emulates most of the common BASIC syntax while adds more advanced and up-to-date concepts gracefully, such as user-defined function that can \emph{actually} recurse, arbitrary list construction using CONS-operator and some of the features in the realm of functional programming such as \code{MAP} and \code{FOLD}.

This is the documentation for \tbas{} \tbasver{}.
