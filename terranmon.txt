Endianness: little
Note: Always takes up the peripheral slot of zero

Latching: latching is used to "lock" the fluctuating values when you attempt to read them so you would get
          reliable values when you try to read them, especially the multibyte values where another byte would
          change after you read one byte, e.g. System uptime in nanoseconds

MMIO

0..31 RO: Raw Keyboard Buffer read. Won't shift the key buffer
32..33 RO: Mouse X pos
34..35 RO: Mouse Y pos
36 RO: Mouse down? (1 for TRUE, 0 for FALSE)
37 RW: Read/Write single key input. Key buffer will be shifted. Manual writing is
    usually unnecessary as such action must be automatically managed via LibGDX
    input processing.
    Stores ASCII code representing the character, plus:
   (1..26: Ctrl+[alph])
    3 : Ctrl+C
    4 : Ctrl+D
    8 : Backspace
   (13: Return)
    19: Up arrow
    20: Down arrow
    21: Left arrow
    22: Right arrow
38 RW: Request keyboard input be read (TTY Function). Write nonzero value to enable, write zero to
    close it. Keyboard buffer will be cleared whenever request is received, so
    MAKE SURE YOU REQUEST THE KEY INPUT ONLY ONCE!
39 WO: Latch Key/Mouse Input (Raw Input function). Write nonzero value to latch.
    Stores LibGDX Key code
40..47 RO: Key Press buffer
    stores keys that are held down. Can accomodate 8-key rollover (in keyboard geeks' terms)
    0x0 is written for the empty area; numbers are always sorted
48..51 RO: System flags
    48: 0b rq00 000t
        t: STOP button (should raise SIGTERM)
        r: RESET button (hypervisor should reset the system)
        q: SysRq button (hypervisor should respond to it)
    49: set to 1 if a key has pushed into key buffer (or, if the system has a key press to pull) via MMIO 38; othewise 0

64..67 RO: User area memory size in bytes
68 WO: Counter latch
    0b 0000 00ba
    a: System uptime
    b: RTC
72..79 RO: System uptime in nanoseconds
80..87 RO: RTC in microseconds

    write 0x00 to map BIOS
    write 0x01 to map first "extra ROM"

89 RW: BMS flags
    0b P000 b0ca
    a: 1 if charging (accepting power from the AC adapter)
    c: 1 if battery is detected
    b: 1 if the device is battery-operated

    P: 1 if CPU halted (so that the "smart" power supply can shut itself down)

    note: only the high nybbles are writable!

    if the device is battery-operated but currently running off of an AC adapter and there is no battery inserted,
    the flag would be 0000 1001

90 RO: BMS calculated battery percentage where 255 is 100%

    To encode an audio to compliant format, use ffmpeg: ffmpeg -i <your_music> -acodec libtwolame -psymodel 4 -b:a <rate>k -ar 32000 <output.mp2>
        Rationale:
        -acodec libtwolame : ffmpeg has two mp2 encoders, and libtwolame produces vastly higher quality audio
        -psymodel 4 : use alternative psychoacoustic model -- the default model (3) tends to insert "clunk" sounds throughout the audio
        -b:a : 256k is recommended for high quality audio (trust me, you don't need 384k)
        -ar 32000 : resample the audio to 32kHz, the sampling rate of the TSVM soundcard

    uint8  Green (0-255)

Frame Timing
    If the global type is not 255, each packet is interpreted as a single full frame, and then will wait for the next
    frame time; For type 255 however, the assumption no longer holds and each frame can have multiple packets, and thus
    needs explicit "sync" packet for proper frame timing.


Comperssion Method
    Old standard used Gzip, new standard is Zstd.
    tsvm will read the zip header and will use appropriate decompression method, so that the old Gzipped
    files remain compatible.


NOTE FROM DEVELOPER
    In the future, the global packet type will be deprecated.

    uint32 UNCOMPRESSED SIZE (somewhat redundant but included for convenience)

- Chroma Subsampled Blocks
    Gzipped unless the z-flag is not set.
    4x4 pixels are sampled, then divided into YCoCg planes.
    CoCg planes are "chroma subsampled" by 4:2:0, then quantised to 4 bits (8 bits for CoCg combined)
    Y plane is quantised to 4 bits

    By doing so, CoCg planes will reduce to 4 pixels
    For the description of packing, pixels in Y/Cx plane will be numbered as:
        Y0 Y1 Y2 Y3 || Cx1   Cx2 | Cx1   Cx2
        Y4 Y5 Y6 Y7 ||  (iPF 1)  | Cx3   Cx4
        Y8 Y9 YA YB || Cx3   Cx4 | Cx5   Cx6
        YC YD YE YF ||  (iPF 1)  | Cx7   Cx8

    Bits are packed like so:

iPF1:
    uint16 [Co4 | Co3 | Co2 | Co1]
    uint16 [Cg4 | Cg3 | Cg2 | Cg1]
    uint16 [Y1 | Y0 | Y5 | Y4]
    uint16 [Y3 | Y2 | Y7 | Y6]
    uint16 [Y9 | Y8 | YD | YC]
    uint16 [YB | YA | YF | YE]
    (total: 12 bytes)

iPF2:
    uint32 [Co8 | Co7 | Co6 | Co5 | Co4 | Co3 | Co2 | Co1]
    uint32 [Cg8 | Cg7 | Cg6 | Cg5 | Cg4 | Cg3 | Cg2 | Cg1]

    uint16 [a9 | a8 | aD | aC]
    uint16 [aB | aA | aF | aE]
    (total: 20/24 bytes)

    Subsampling mask:

    Least significant byte for top-left, most significant for bottom-right
    For example, this default pattern

    00 00 01 01
    00 00 01 01
    10 10 11 11
    10 10 11 11

    turns into:

    01010000 -> 0x30
    01010000 -> 0x30
    11111010 -> 0xFA
    11111010 -> 0xFA

    which packs into: [ 30 | 30 | FA | FA ] (because little endian)

iPF1-delta (for video encoding):

Delta encoded frames contain "insutructions" for patch-encoding the existing frame.
Or, a collection of [StateChangeCode] [Optional VarInts] [Payload...] pairs

States:
0x00 SKIP [varint skipCount]
0x01 PATCH [varint blockCount] [12x blockCount bytes]
0x02 REPEAT [varint repeatCount] [a block]
0xFF END

Sample stream:
    [SKIP 10] [PATCH A] [REPEAT 3] [SKIP 5] [PATCH B] [END]

Delta block format:

    Each PATCH delta payload is still:
        8 bytes of Luma (4-bit deltas for 16 pixels)
        2 bytes of Co deltas (4× 4-bit deltas)
        2 bytes of Cg deltas (4× 4-bit deltas)
    Total: 12 bytes per PATCH.

    These are always relative to the same-position block in the previous frame.

TSVM Enhanced Video (TEV) Format
Created by Claude on 2025-08-17

TEV is a modern video codec optimized for TSVM's 4096-color hardware, featuring
DCT-based compression, motion compensation, and efficient temporal coding.

## Version History
- Version 2.0: YCoCg-R 4:2:0 with 16x16/8x8 DCT blocks
- Version 2.1: Added Rate Control Factor to all video packets (breaking change)
  * Enables bitrate-constrained encoding alongside quality modes
  * All video frames now include 4-byte rate control factor after payload size
- Version 3.0: Additional support of ICtCp Colour space

# File Structure

    uint8  Quality Index for Co channel (0-99; 100 denotes all quantiser is 1)
    uint8  Quality Index for Cg channel (0-99; 100 denotes all quantiser is 1)
    uint8  Extra Feature Flags

            - bit 1 = has subtitle
    uint8  Video Flags
            - bit 0 = is interlaced (should be default for most non-archival TEV videos)

    0xFF: sync packet

## Video Packet Structure
    uint8  Packet Type
    uint32 Compressed Size
    *      Zstd-compressed Block Data

## Block Data (per 16x16 block)
    uint8  Mode: encoding mode
           0x00 = SKIP (copy from previous frame)
           0x01 = INTRA (DCT-coded, no prediction)
           0x02 = INTER (DCT-coded with motion compensation) -- currently unused due to bugs
           0x03 = MOTION (motion vector only)
    int16  Motion Vector X ("capable of" 1/4 pixel precision, integer precision for now)
    int16  Motion Vector Y ("capable of" 1/4 pixel precision, integer precision for now)
    float32  Rate Control Factor (4 bytes, little-endian)
    uint16 Coded Block Pattern (which 8x8 have non-zero coeffs)
    int16[256]  DCT Coefficients Y
    int16[64]  DCT Coefficients Co (subsampled by two)
    int16[64]  DCT Coefficients Cg (subsampled by two, aggressively quantised)
        For SKIP and MOTION mode, DCT coefficients are filled with zero

## DCT Quantization and Rate Control
TEV uses 5 quality levels (0=lowest, 4=highest) with progressive quantization
tables optimized for perceptual quality. DC coefficients are encoded losslessly,
while AC coefficients are quantized according to quality tables.

### Rate Control Factor
Each block includes a Rate Control Factor that modifies quality level for that specific block.
This feature allows more efficient coding by allows higher quality for complex blocks and lower quality for
flat blocks.

## Motion Compensation
- Search range: ±8 pixels
- Sub-pixel precision: 1/4 pixel (again, integer precision for now)
- Block size: 16x16 pixels
- Uses Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) for motion estimation
- Bilinear interpolation for sub-pixel motion vectors

## Colour Space
TEV operates in 8-Bit colour mode, colour space conversion required

## Compression Features
- 16x16 DCT blocks (vs 4x4 in iPF)
- Temporal prediction with motion compensation
- Rate-distortion optimized mode selection
- Hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding functions

## Performance Comparison
TEV achieves 60-80% better compression than iPF formats while maintaining
equivalent visual quality, with significantly faster decode performance due
to larger block sizes and hardware acceleration.

## Audio Support
Reuses existing MP2 audio infrastructure from TSVM MOV format for seamless
compatibility with existing audio processing pipeline.

## Simple Subtitle Format
SSF is a simple subtitle that is intended to use text buffer to display texts.
The format is designed to be compatible with SubRip and SAMI (without markups).

### SSF Packet Structure
    uint24 index (used to specify target subtitle object)
    uint8 opcode
          0x00 = <argument terminator>, is NOP when used here
          0x01 = show (arguments: UTF-8 text)
          0x02 = hide (arguments: none)
          0x03 = move to different nonant (arguments: 0x00-bottom centre; 0x01-bottom left; 0x02-centre left; 0x03-top left; 0x04-top centre; 0x05-top right; 0x06-centre right; 0x07-bottom right; 0x08-centre
          0x10..0x2F = show in alternative languages (arguments: char[5] language code, UTF-8 text)
          0x80 = upload to low font rom (arguments: uint16 payload length, var bytes)
          0x81 = upload to high font rom (arguments: uint16 payload length, var bytes)
            note: changing the font rom will change the appearance of the every subtitle currently being displayed
    *    arguments separated AND terminated by 0x00
            text argument may be terminated by 0x00 BEFORE the entire arguments being terminated by 0x00,
            leaving extra 0x00 on the byte stream. A decoder must be able to handle the extra zeros.

        int16[] HL_coeffs: quantized HL subband (high-low frequencies)  
        int16[] HH_coeffs: quantized HH subband (high-high frequencies)

## DWT Implementation Details

### Wavelet Filters
- 5/3 Reversible Filter (lossless capable):
  * Analysis: Low-pass [1/2, 1, 1/2], High-pass [-1/8, -1/4, 3/4, -1/4, -1/8]
  * Synthesis: Low-pass [1/4, 1/2, 1/4], High-pass [-1/16, -1/8, 3/8, -1/8, -1/16]

- 9/7 Irreversible Filter (higher compression):
  * Analysis: Daubechies 9/7 coefficients optimized for image compression
  * Provides better energy compaction than 5/3 but lossy reconstruction

### Decomposition Levels
- Level 1: 112x112 → 56x56 (LL) + 3×56x56 subbands (LH,HL,HH)
- Level 2: 56x56 → 28x28 (LL) + 3×28x28 subbands  
- Level 3: 28x28 → 14x14 (LL) + 3×14x14 subbands
- Level 4: 14x14 → 7x7 (LL) + 3×7x7 subbands
- Level 5: 7x7 → 3x3 (LL) + 3×3x3 subbands
- Level 6: 3x3 → 1x1 (LL) + 3×1x1 subbands (maximum)

### Quantization Strategy
TAV uses different quantization steps for each subband based on human visual
system sensitivity:
- LL subbands: Fine quantization (preserve DC and low frequencies)
- LH/HL subbands: Medium quantization (diagonal details less critical)  
- HH subbands: Coarse quantization (high frequency noise can be discarded)

### Progressive Transmission
When enabled, coefficients are transmitted in order of visual importance:
1. LL subband of highest decomposition level (thumbnail)
2. Lower frequency subbands first
3. Higher frequency subbands for refinement

## Motion Compensation
- Search range: ±28 pixels (optimized for 112x112 tiles)
- Sub-pixel precision: 1/4 pixel with bilinear interpolation
- Tile size: 112x112 pixels (perfect fit for TSVM 560x448 resolution)
  * Exactly 5×4 = 20 tiles per frame (560÷112 = 5, 448÷112 = 4)
  * No partial tiles needed - optimal for processing efficiency
- Uses Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) for motion estimation
- Overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) for smooth boundaries

## Colour Space  
TAV operates in YCoCg-R colour space with full resolution channels:
- Y: Luma channel (full resolution, fine quantization)
- Co: Orange-Cyan chroma (full resolution, aggressive quantization by default)  
- Cg: Green-Magenta chroma (full resolution, very aggressive quantization by default)

## Compression Features
- 112x112 DWT tiles vs 16x16 DCT blocks in TEV
- Multi-resolution representation enables scalable decoding
- Better frequency localization than DCT
- Reduced blocking artifacts due to overlapping basis functions
- Region-of-Interest (ROI) coding for selective quality enhancement
- Progressive transmission for bandwidth adaptation

## Performance Comparison  
Expected improvements over TEV:
- 20-30% better compression efficiency
- Reduced blocking artifacts
- Scalable quality/resolution decoding
- Better performance on natural images vs artificial content
- Full resolution chroma preserves color detail while aggressive quantization maintains compression

## Hardware Acceleration Functions
TAV decoder requires new GraphicsJSR223Delegate functions:
- tavDecode(): Main DWT decoding function
- tavDWT2D(): 2D DWT/IDWT transforms  
- tavQuantize(): Multi-band quantization
- tavMotionCompensate(): 64x64 tile motion compensation

## Audio Support
Reuses existing MP2 audio infrastructure from TEV/MOV formats for compatibility.

## Subtitle Support  
Uses same Simple Subtitle Format (SSF) as TEV for text overlay functionality.

3..5 RW: Block transfer status for Disk 2
6..8 RW: Block transfer status for Disk 3
9..11 RW: Block transfer status for Disk 4
12..15 RW: Block transfer control for Disk 1 through 4
    0b 0000 abcd

    a: 1 for send, 0 for receive

    b-write: 1 to start sending if a-bit is set; if a-bit is unset, make other device to start sending
    b-read: if this bit is set, you're currently receiving something (aka busy)

    c-write: I'm ready to receive
    c-read: Are you ready to receive?

    d-read: Are you there? (if the other device's recipient is myself)

    NOTE: not ready AND not busy (bits b and d set when read) means the device is not connected to the port
16..19 RW: 8-bit status code for the disk
20 RW: Currently active disk (0: deselect all disk, 1: select disk #1, ...)

    Selecting a disk will automatically unset and hold down "I'm ready to receive" flags of the other disks,
    however, the target disk will NOT have its "I'm ready to receive" flag automatically set.

-- SEQUENTIAL IO SUPPORT MODULE --

NOTE: Sequential I/O will clobber the peripheral memory space.

256..257 RW: Sequential I/O control flags

258 RW: Opcode. Writing a value to this memory will execute the operation
    0x00 - No operation
    0x01 - Skip (arg 1) bytes
    0x02 - Read (arg 1) bytes and store to core memory pointer (arg 2)
    0x03 - Write (arg 1) bytes using data from the core memory from pointer (arg 2)
    0xF0 - Rewind the file to the starting point
    0xFF - Terminate sequential I/O session and free up the memory space
259..261 RW: Argument #1
262..264 RW: Argument #2
265..267 RW: Argument #3
268..270 RW: Argument #4


Memory Space

0..1048575 RW: Buffer for the block transfer lane
    IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION: split the memory space into two 512K blocks, and when the sequential
    reading reaches the second space, prepare the next bytes in the first memory space, so that the read
    cursor reaches 1048576, it wraps into 0 and continue reading the content of the disk as if nothing happend.
