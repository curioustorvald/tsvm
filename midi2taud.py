    # Batch / directory mode (terranmon.txt:3342-3401):
    python3 midi2taud.py midi_dir/ soundfont.sf2 [out_dir/]

  When the first argument is a DIRECTORY, every .mid/.midi inside it is compiled
  against the one SoundFont into the split Taud format: a single shared Sample and
  Instrument Image (<soundfont>.tsii) holding the instrument bank for all the songs,
  plus one Pattern Image (<song>.tpif) per MIDI carrying just that song's patterns.
  A .tpif is played by first loading its companion .tsii. The shared bank spans the
  UNION of every song's instruments, so the 8 MB sample / 255 slot budgets are shared
  too (overflow degrades exactly as in single-file mode). Instrument fadeouts encode
  SF2 release times in seconds but the engine fades per song-tick (rate ∝ BPM), so the
  shared image targets the mean of the songs' initial tempos; pass --fadeout for a
  tempo-independent step. Output directory defaults to the input directory.

Behaviour (per midi2taud.md):
  * Pitch bends are preserved as much as possible. A note starting under a
    non-zero bend triggers directly at the bent 4096-TET pitch (Taud notes
    are 4096-TET, so the trigger encodes the exact shifted pitch). Bend
    movement during a note is approximated as linear segments: each segment
    is one row carrying the exact 4096-TET target note plus tone portamento
    (G $xxxx, units/tick) sized to land on the target by row end. Jittery
    curves are simplified via --bend-epsilon (cents). RPN 0,0 pitch-bend
    range messages are honoured; bend values are computed as floats from
    the full 14-bit word (MIDIs that only drive the MSB work transparently).
  * Both MIDI key-off idioms — real note-off messages and note-on with
    velocity 0 — are translated into Taud KEY_OFF. Percussion-channel
    key-offs are dropped by default (GM percussion ignores note-off, and
    emitting them would chop one-shot drum tails); --drum-keyoff re-enables.
  * The SF2 key/velocity sample-layering model is recreated faithfully. Each
    preset's zones are partitioned into the fewest mutually-DISJOINT layers
    (--max-layers cap, default 4); each layer becomes one normal Taud instrument
    with its zones as Ixmp patches (velocity axis round(vel × 63/127)). A preset
    needing >1 layer is emitted as a Metainstrument (terranmon.txt "Metainstrument
    definition"): the note references the meta slot and the engine fans out one
    voice per matching layer, so SF2's simultaneous layering (and detune-stacks)
    now sound — overlapping zones are no longer dropped. Single-layer presets stay
    plain instruments. Stereo SF2 samples are mixed to mono. Unused instruments,
    patches, and samples are trimmed.
  * The SF2 volume-envelope ADSR is preserved on the (instrument-scope) Taud
    volume envelope: delay/attack/hold/decay nodes and a sustain region held
    while the key is on. There is NO release leg — the SF2 *release segment*
    is the Volume Fadeout (with NNA Note Fade): on key-off the voice holds at
    the sustain node and fades to silence over the SF2 releaseVolEnv time
    (the full release, scaled to FluidSynth's PERCEIVED release length because
    the engine's fadeout is linear in amplitude, not dB — see _zone_fadeout).
    Per-layer Ixmp patches carry their own fadeout when their release differs.
    The canonical zone's ADSR represents the instrument.
  * Polyphony rides the engine's New Note Action (matching MIDI semantics):
    every instrument (drum kits included) gets NNA = Note Fade, so a voice
    column is reusable the moment its note releases — the release/fade tail
    moves to a background ghost on the next trigger and dies over its own
    release time. Voice budget defaults to 16 columns (--max-voices); overflow
    releases the oldest pedal-held or soonest-ending note early, not cut.
  * SF2 exclusiveClass (gen 57) is honoured on the percussion channel: a new note
    in a class chokes any ringing note of the same class (e.g. a closed hi-hat
    silences a ringing open hi-hat), matching FluidSynth's kill-by-exclusive-class.
    The choke is the new fast note-fade (note 0x0004, ~0.3 s) emitted at the next
    same-class onset; without it long percussion tails wash over the whole beat.
  * Sub-row timing is carried by S $Dx note delays (one row = `--speed`
    ticks; one beat = `--rpb` rows). The grid (Tickspeed + RPB) is auto-set by
    default from the tempo map, the MIDI time signatures and onset-subdivision
    analysis: rpb·speed fine-ticks per beat is chosen to represent the finest
    subdivision actually used, keep every tempo inside the Taud BPM register
    (25..535), and stay near the proven 24-fts/beat grid — so plain 4/4 @ 120
    BPM still reproduces the old speed 6 / rpb 4. Passing --rpb or --speed pins
    that axis and auto-fits the other; pass both to fully override. As a final
    step, a bend- or polyphony-heavy song with rpb < 8 has its rpb doubled (and
    speed halved, so F and the tempo are unchanged) up to 8: the extra rows give
    key-offs, exclusiveClass chokes, bend portamento (G) and channel-volume (M)
    effects more distinct rows to land on, so fewer are eaten by same-row / per-
    cell-slot collisions. Disabled by pinning --rpb or --speed.
    MIDI tempo changes map to T $xx00 set-tempo effects (or T $FFxx extended
    set-tempo above 280 BPM); channel volume /
    expression (CC7 × CC11) map to M $xx00 channel-volume effects so they
    never disturb the velocity-driven patch selection axis.
  * Cues are broken at every time-signature change, and each section is packed
    into whole-bar cues (the largest multiple of its bar length that fits in 64
    rows) so the tracker's bar/beat highlighting (sMet beat divisions) lines up
    with the music.
  * Looping. A MIDI that carries its own loop markers is ALWAYS made to loop at
    those points (regardless of --loop); --loop additionally loops a marker-less
    MIDI start-to-end. Recognised loop-marker conventions (case-insensitive,
    first occurrence wins; resolved in this priority):
      - FF 06 / FF 01 text STARTING with "loops" (loop start) / "loope" (end);
      - CC #116 (loop start) + CC #117 (loop end);
      - CC #110 (loop start) + CC #111 (loop end);
      - CC #111 alone = loop START, loop end = End-of-Track (FF 2F 00).
    A missing loop end defaults to End-of-Track. The loop is realised as a cue
    jump: when it spans complete full-length cues from a cue boundary, the final
    cue's HALT is replaced with a JMP back to the loop-start cue; otherwise an
    in-pattern order jump (effect B → loop-start cue, plus effect C → row when
    the loop start is mid-cue) is placed on the last looped row. Cues after the
    loop end are dropped.
    --loop (whole song) rounds its loop-end UP to the next bar line by default,
    so the loop seam stays on the beat grid (and usually lands on a full cue → a
    clean JMP); --loop-at-eot loops exactly at End-of-Track instead. Bar rounding
    never applies to explicit MIDI loop markers — those loop verbatim.

    FluidSynth's release (fluid_rvoice.c:54-55, fluid_voice.c:1092-1094) ramps the
    volume-envelope coefficient LINEARLY from its value at key-off down to 0, where
    amplitude = cb2amp(960·(1−volenv_val)) — i.e. the coefficient is linear in dB. The
    release rate is fixed: a full 1.0→0 ramp takes `releaseVolEnv` seconds, so a note
    released at coefficient v reaches silence in v·releaseVolEnv. v is HIGH whenever the
    note is still audible at key-off — which is the norm for the long-decay instruments
    (bells, organs, harpsichord, sitar, mute guitar) that Timbres of Heaven & friends
    encode with a silent sustain (sustainVolEnv≈1000 cB) and a multi-second decay: the
    decay IS the sound, and the key is lifted long before it reaches the silent sustain.
    So the fadeout must reflect the FULL releaseVolEnv, NOT a sustain-scaled fraction.

    The earlier model scaled by (1000−sus_cb)/1000 (the release time FROM the sustain
    level), which is only correct for a note held all the way to its sustain. For the
    decay instruments above (sus_cb≈1000) it collapsed to ~0 → an instant cut on key-off
    instead of FluidSynth's seconds-long release — released organ/bell/harpsichord notes
    were chopped off. Dropping the factor leaves the common sustained instruments
    (sus_cb≈0, factor was ≈1) unchanged and gives the decay instruments a real release.

    The engine's fadeout is linear in AMPLITUDE while FluidSynth's release is linear in
    dB (see [_RELEASE_PERCEPTUAL_SCALE]); matching the floor-reaching time would make the
    audible tail ~4× too long, so fade_sec is scaled to FluidSynth's perceived release.
    fadeStep makes the fadeout complete in fade_sec at bpm0: the engine subtracts

    when every column is busy (true simultaneous polyphony > cap) does it steal
    (soonest-ending / sustain-pedal-held first, the graceful NNA early-release).
    Because parts peak at different times, the global peak is usually far below
    the SUMMED per-part peaks, so borrowing absorbs the overflow with no steals on
    typical songs — matching the old global-greedy column count while keeping the
    per-part layout. Only when there are literally more parts than columns
